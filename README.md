# dice_set

My first Flutter project to create a set of dice for a user to roll on their mobile device. 

## Future Plans
  - Will make it so 2D dice will appear
  - With a push of a button the dice with change numbers
  - Let the user select what type of dice they want (D6, D12, D20, etc.) and how many they want to roll
    - Might need to use a chart to show results depending on screen size and number of dice
  - Add animations and sound to make it seems the dice are rolling
  - Create a 3D model of dice to make the rolling seem more real.
  - Let user customize the appearance of their dice.
